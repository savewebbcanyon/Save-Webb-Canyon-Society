# Save-Webb-Canyon-Society

# The Save Webb Canyon Society was started in July of 2021 by members of the Webb Canyon community in Claremont, California.  Our purpose is to educate residents of Webb Canyon in Claremont and surrounding areas regarding the City of Claremont's proposed construction project, called the "Clara Oaks Specific Plan Project" or the "Clara Oaks Project".  
# The proposed project currently includes a proposal to build 47-94 housing units in the hills right above the Webb School football field, despite the fact that the only road in or out of the Clara Oaks subdivision is a narrow one-lane road that cannot handle the projected traffic, particularly if there is a fire or a need to quickly evacuate the area.  Our hope is that educated residents will decide to oppose the development of the Clara Oaks Project, thus preserving the natural beauty of Webb Canyon for future generations. 
# There is no fee to become a member of the Save Webb Canyon Society.  Because the group is small and new, we do not yet have official status as a non-profit organization, and we are not accepting donations at this time.  However, we do encourage you to download our Society logo and create your own "marketing materials" such as t-shirts, lawn signs, bumper stickers, etc.  We also encourage you to spread the word about our group on your social media accounts.
